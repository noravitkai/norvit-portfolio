                not only aesthetically pleasing, but also enhances user
                experience and effectively communicates the brand's message.
                During the creation, the company's values, mission, and vision
                were taken into account, so that these statements are properly
                reflected in the visual appearance.

                I was approached by MarketingPuzzle to design a new logo that

                memorable, and easily recognisable. As an idea-oriented
                marketing agency, MarketingPuzzle needed a logo that reflects
                their commitment to creative problem-solving and continuous
                pursuit of innovation. Besides that, the logo's distinctive
                design has set MarketingPuzzle apart from local competitors in
                the marketing industry.
