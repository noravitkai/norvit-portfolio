            <p class="text-base">
              I was approached by MarketingPuzzle to design a new logo that
              would accurately convey the essence of the brand. The primary
              objective was to create a logo that is visually appealing,
              memorable, and easily recognisable. As an idea-oriented marketing
              agency, MarketingPuzzle needed a logo that reflects their
              commitment to creative problem-solving and continuous pursuit of
              innovation. Besides that, the logo's distinctive design has set
              MarketingPuzzle apart from local competitors in the marketing
              industry.

              I had the pleasure of collaborating with Pillér Épker, a building
              material trade in Hungary, to create a new logo that resonates
              with the brand's target audience. As a company in the construction
              industry, it was important to reflect their focus on quality,
              reliability, and strength. Keeping the core values of the brand in
              mind, I designed a logo that features a modern and minimalist
              style with a twist, as the main feature of the logo is the letter
              "P," which forms a pillar referring to the meaning of the word
              “Pillér”.
